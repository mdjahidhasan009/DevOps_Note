## RDS Deployment Architectures

### RDS Read Replica - Multi Region
* **Primary DB Instance**: One primary DB instance in one region handles read and write operations
* **Read Replica**: Another instance in asynchronous replication with the primary DB instance in another region, used for read operations only
* **Use Cases**: Disaster recovery, geographic distribution, read scaling

```
Primary Region (us-east-1)
├── Primary RDS Instance (Read/Write)
└── Local Read Replica (Read Only)

Secondary Region (us-west-2)
├── Cross-Region Read Replica (Read Only)
└── Can be promoted to primary for DR
```

#### Cross-Region Read Replica Benefits
- **Disaster Recovery**: Can be promoted to primary in case of region failure
- **Geographic Distribution**: Serve users from multiple regions with low latency
- **Read Scaling**: Distribute read traffic across multiple regions
- **Compliance**: Meet data residency requirements

### RDS Multi-AZ Deployments

#### Multi-AZ DB Instance (Traditional)
* **Primary DB Instance**: One primary DB instance in one availability zone handles read and write operations
* **Standby Instance**: Synchronous replication with the primary DB instance in another availability zone, used for read and write operations only when the primary DB instance is down
* **Purpose**: High availability and automatic failover

```
Availability Zone A
├── Primary DB Instance
│   ├── Handles all read/write operations
│   └── Synchronously replicates to standby

Availability Zone B
├── Standby DB Instance
│   ├── Receives synchronous replication
│   ├── Not accessible for read operations
│   └── Automatic failover target
```

#### Multi-AZ DB Cluster (Aurora Style for RDS)
* **Primary DB Instance**: One primary DB instance in one availability zone handles read and write operations
* **Read Replicas**: Two or more read replicas in other availability zones (excluding primary AZ) handle read operations only
* **Replication**: Asynchronous replication with the primary DB instance

```
Multi-AZ Cluster Architecture
├── Writer Instance (AZ-1) - Read/Write
├── Reader Instance (AZ-2) - Read Only
├── Reader Instance (AZ-3) - Read Only
└── Shared Storage (Replicated across AZs)
```

#### Multi-AZ Comparison

| Feature | Multi-AZ DB Instance | Multi-AZ DB Cluster |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Read Scaling** | No (standby not accessible) | Yes (multiple readers) |
| **Failover Time** | 1-2 minutes | Under 1 minute |
| **Reader Endpoints** | None | Multiple read endpoints |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Use Case** | High availability only | HA + read scaling |

## RDS Instance Quick Setup

### RDS Instance
* Create a RDS MySQL instance
    * Use Free Tier
    * Username will be 'admin' and you can set password (you can't use special character)
    * Keep the Public access to True to access it from Local or remote server
    * Create a security group (and allow 3306 from everywhere)
    * After creating, you can find Endpoint (hostname) to connect to this DB.

### EC2 Instance
```shell
sudo yum install -y docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
sudo docker pull philippaul/node-mysql-app:02
```

for ubuntu
```shell
# 1. Update package list and install Docker
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io

# 2. Start the Docker service (systemctl is the modern standard)
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# 3. Add the 'ubuntu' user to the 'docker' group
# Note: On Ubuntu EC2 instances, the default user is 'ubuntu'.
# Using $USER is a more portable way to refer to the current user.
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# IMPORTANT: You need to log out and log back in for the group change to take effect.
# Alternatively, you can run `newgrp docker` in your current shell.

# 4. Pull the Docker image (this command is the same)
docker pull philippaul/node-mysql-app:02
```

```
docker run --rm -p 80:3000 -e DB_HOST="your-db-hostname" -e DB_USER="your-db-username" -e DB_PASSWORD="your-db-password" -d philippaul/node-mysql-app:02
```

**Configuration Details:**
- `DB_HOST`: Go to Aurora and RDS > Databases > click on your database > At Connectivity & security tab > Endpoint. Copy the endpoint without port number
- `DB_USER`: For our case it is 'admin'

```
docker run -it --rm mysql:8.0 mysql -h db.example.com -u admin -p
```

## Practical Implementation Example

Server is running on http://localhost:3000
Database "my_app_db" is ready.
Using database "my_app_db"
Table "contacts" is ready.
```

Now if we visit the public ip of EC2 instance in browser, we can see the app running and we can add contacts to the
database.

Inside the EC2 terminal we can run the following command to connect to the RDS MySQL database:

```shell
docker run -it --rm mysql:8.0 mysql -h database-1.ctsksu2mqlap.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
```

Then enter the password you set during RDS creation.

### Database Connection Results
```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-22-50:~$ sudo docker run -it --rm mysql:8.0 mysql \
  -h database-1.ctsksu2mqlap.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p

+----+-----------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Now at the database dashboard we will see two connections, one from the EC2 instance and one from the Docker container
running the Node.js app.
