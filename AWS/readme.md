AWS offers a vast range of services, including compute power, storage solutions, networking, databases, and much more.

It offers a pay-as-you-go model, allowing you to pay only for what you use, which is ideal for optimizing costs

AWS was launched in 2006 as the first public cloud platform

Started with Amazon S3 for storage and EC2 for compute power.

Now expanded into offering over 200 fully-featured services across various domains like AI, machine learning, IoT, and 
more...

**AWS is known for its scalability, reliability, and global reach, with data centers in multiple regions worldwide.**

#### Popular Services Provided by AWS
Most popular ones include EC2 for scalable compute capacity, S3 for highly reliable storage, RDS for managed databases, 
Lambda for serverless computing, and CloudFront for content delivery.


#### AWS Regions and Availability Zones
AWS operates in multiple geographic regions, each containing multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
This design provides high availability and fault tolerance, allowing users to deploy applications across multiple AZs
for redundancy and low latency.

#### AWS Local Zones
Local Zones are an extension of AWS Regions that place compute, storage, and other select services closer to end-users
to reduce latency for applications that require single-digit millisecond response times.
