### How to choose aws region
* **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements:** data never leaves a region without your explicit
  permission
* **Proximity to customers:** reduced latency
* **Available services within a Region:** new services and new features aren't available in every Region
* **Pricing:** pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

# AWS Availability Zones

*  Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
   *  ap-southeast-2a
   *  ap-southeast-2b
   *  ap-southeast-2c
*  Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
*  They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters
*  They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking


# AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

*  Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations & 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
*  Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
