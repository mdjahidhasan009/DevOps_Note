On demand delivery of computing resources over the internet is known as **Cloud Computing**. It allows users to access
and use computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more without the need for
owning or managing physical hardware. Cloud computing provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness by
allowing users to pay for only the resources they use, and it can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Key Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-use model eliminates upfront hardware costs
- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand
- **Accessibility**: Access resources from anywhere with internet connection
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and backup systems
- **Maintenance**: No need to manage physical hardware or software updates
- **Speed**: Quick deployment of resources and applications


## Types of cloud computing
### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers
(virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and
management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT
departments and developers are familiar.

**Examples**: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VMs <br/>
**Use Cases**: Web hosting, backup and recovery, high-performance computing

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows
you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don't need
to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other
undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

**Examples**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku <br/>
**Use Cases**: Application development, API development, business analytics

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people
referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don't have
to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think
about how you will use that particular software.

**Examples**: Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Dropbox, Slack <br/>
**Use Cases**: Email services, CRM systems, collaboration tools, productivity software

## Different Types of Cloud Deployment Models
### Public Cloud
A shared cloud environment where multiple users can access services over the internet, like AWS or Azure.

### Private Cloud
A dedicated cloud environment for one organization, offering more control and privacy.

### Hybrid Cloud
A mix of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them for flexibility.
